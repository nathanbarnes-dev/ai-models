Based on the results you've provided, XGBoost is the best performing model. Here's why:

Highest R² Score (0.924031):

R² measures how much of the variance in settlement values your model explains
XGBoost explains approximately 92.4% of the variance, which is significantly better than the other models
This is the most important metric for overall model quality


Good RMSE (239.636461):

While not the lowest RMSE (Random Forest has a lower RMSE), XGBoost still performs well on this metric
This means the typical prediction error is around $240


Competitive MAE (138.830618):

Again, while not the absolute lowest (Random Forest has 124.44), it's still quite good
This means on average, predictions are about $139 away from actual values



The Random Forest model comes in second place with a slightly lower RMSE and MAE but a notably lower R² score (0.905027 vs. 0.924031). This suggests that while Random Forest might have slightly better performance on some individual predictions, XGBoost captures more of the overall patterns in the data.
The significant gap between these two tree-based models and the linear models (Linear, Ridge, and Lasso Regression) indicates that the settlement values likely have non-linear relationships with the input features that the more complex models can capture better.
For your insurance settlement prediction task, XGBoost would be the recommended choice based on these metrics.
